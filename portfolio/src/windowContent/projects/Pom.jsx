        After my cat passed away senior year of 
        college, I found myself struggling to focus on work.
        I set out to build a cat-themed timer app to help
        using the â€œPomodoro Technique", and started  
        hand-drawing icons based on my pet.

        <p className='blog-text-b'> 
        I digitized assets in Photoshop, translated 
        sketches into detailed wireframes using Figma,and then
        implemented the app in Swift. The project not only helped
        me manage time but also became a meaningful 
        homage to my kitty.
